# Angular2 scaffold 

This scaffold should provide a strting point for an Angular2 application written in Typescript. The base structure and configurations are from Deborah Kurata''s Pluralsight training [Angular2: Getting started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started/table-of-contents).
Thanks for inspirational to get me going with Typescript.

## Prerequisities

You need to have a working node.js installation. I tested the scaffold with node 5.4.x and npm 3.3.x, so anything higher will probably work also.

## Installation

* Download the zip or clone this repository into you project folder. 
* Run npm install to install the required libraries.
* Build a folder structure under the app folder to match your application. E.G. if you build a blog add a posts folder where all your components to handle posts will go.
* Edit index.html and change the name and tag for your main component.
